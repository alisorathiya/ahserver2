Clear is Allah of what they allege!” [Qur’an 23:91] If there were two gods, as you claim, each one of them would seek superiority, and if one of them desired to create a man, the other would desire to oppose him and create an animal, so their joint creation would have to be the product of both their desires, in spite of their differing wills, man and beast at the same time. And this is the most impossible thing that does not even exist. And if this argument is invalid and there is no difference between them, then the whole duality is invalid [with no distinction left between the two] and there is only one. Therefore, this order, unity of arrangement, subsistence of some things through other things, all indicate to One Maker, and this is the purport of Allah’s verse in the Qur’an: “Allah has not taken any offspring neither is there any god besides Him…” and “Had there been gods in them (i.e. the heavens and the earth) other than Allah, they would surely have fallen apart.”[ Nur al-Thaqalayn, v. 3, p. 550, no. 107]"

"It is narrated in Misbah al-Shari`aa (The Lantern of the Path): ‘The lowest level of thankfulness is to see the bounty as coming from Allah irrespective of its cause, and without attaching the heart to any other cause save Allah, Mighty and Exalted.
